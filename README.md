This tutorial covers the basic population genetics analyses for a set of populations (or closely related species)
1) Evaluating, filtering and plotting the genetic data
2) Test for Hardy-Weinberg-Equilibrium (HWE) and linkage between loci
3) Calculating, assessing and plotting genotypic richness and diversity, heterozygosity, F-statistics, and isolation-by-distance (IBD)
4) Performing and plotting principal component analyses (PCA) and discriminant analyses of principal components (DAPC)
5) Creating maps based on the DAPC results
